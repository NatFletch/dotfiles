# NatFletch's Dotfiles
A repository containing all my config files to make distro hoppibg a lot faster and easier

This repository contains my Qtile config which is modified from Derek Taylor's Qtile config (https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles), my Alacritty config using the breeze color theme, and my neovim config using Kickstart nvim. This also has my custom .xprofile and .zshrc!

This repository is still under development.
